# download-manifest.py

This is a simple script to download manifests from Docker hub. It is done via this v2 registry API call:

```
/v2/{repository}/manifests/{tag}
```

Sample usage:

```
$ ./download-manifest.py registry
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "fsLayers": [
    {
      "blobSum": "sha256:a3ed95caeb02ffe68cdd9fd84406680ae93d633cb16422d00e8a7c22955b46d4"
    },
    {
      "blobSum": "sha256:a3ed95caeb02ffe68cdd9fd84406680ae93d633cb16422d00e8a7c22955b46d4"
    },
...
```

# Download manifests from Docker Hub
13 JUNE 2016
So we needed to fetch manifests of repositories from Docker Hub today. Itâ€™s not that hard. 30 lines of python can do it. But at the same time, you need to read docs with all the specs.

## Authentication
The biggest pain. pull seems to be a privileged operation which requires authentication. Luckily you only need to obtain a token:

```bash
repo = "library/fedora"
login_template = "https://auth.docker.io/token?service=registry.docker.io&scope=repository:{repository}:pull"
token = requests.get(login_template.format(repository=repo), json=True).json()["token"]
```
This is documented nicely [here](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/auth/token/).

API call for getting the manifest
That one is documented over [here](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/#manifest).

GET /v2/{repository}/manifests/{tag}
Nothing really to talk about: just fetch manifest of requested repository.

```python
get_manifest_template = "https://registry.hub.docker.com/v2/{repository}/manifests/{tag}"
manifest = requests.get(
    get_manifest_template.format(repository=repo, tag=tag),
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer {}".format(token)},
    json=True
).json()
```
